* First two letters indicate piece and color (`R` = Rook, `N` = Knight, `B` = Bishop, `Q` = Queen, `K` = King, `P` = Pawn)
* Last letter indicates color: `B` = Black, `W` = White
* `--` represents an empty square

#### ‚ôüÔ∏è Sample Input:

```
RB NB BB QB KB BB NB RB
PB PB PB PB PB PB PB PB
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
